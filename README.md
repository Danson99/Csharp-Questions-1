Q: What is a namespace?
A: A namespace is a domain where the type names are unique.

Q: What are value types?
A: Value types can be assigned to any value directly.

Q: What are reference types?
A: Reference types hold the location of the variable.

Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
A: The automatic property tells the compiler to automatically read and write a private field of the same type as the property.

Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
A: The purpose of using statement is to include the namespaces in the program.

Q: What are dynamic type variables?
A: The dynamic type variable changes its type at runtime instead of compile time.

Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
A: The purpose of the is operator is to figure out whether an object is of a certain type.

Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
A: Generics allow you to write a class or method that works with any data type. It can be useful because you can create your own class or method and use them for future codes.

Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
A: The public access specifier.

Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
A: Yes you can use a keyword called params that accepts a varying number of arguments.

Q: How do you sort an array?
A: You sort an array by using Array.Sort which sorts an array by ascending order.

Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
A: A nullable type is a nonexistent value used for Value Types.

Q: What is an enumeration?
A: An enumeration is a set of named integer constants.

Q: What is inheritance?
A: Inheritance allows you to create classes that inherits characteristics from an existing class.

Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
A: C# does not support multiple inheritance.

Q: What is the purpose of as operator
A: The purpose of as operator is to cast without raising an exception if the cast fails.

Q: What is an object?
A: An object is an instance of a class that is created dynamically.

Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
A: A struct is used to represent a record and a class is used to define what objects are in the class.

Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
A: The continue statement skips to the next iteration and the break statement stops the iteration statement. 

Q: What is this and how is it used?
A: The this is used to represent the this pointer of a class or struct. It is used when you need to pass an instance of the current class or struct to the outside classes and methods.

Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
A: Try is used to identify a code of block for which particular exceptions is activated and catch is used to indicate the catching of an exception.

Q: How is exception handling done?
A: Exeption handling is done by using its four keyword components try, catch, and finally.

Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
A: Finally is used to execute a given set of statements.

Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
A: An array is used to store a collection of data like a bunch of variables of the same type. An array list is just like an array but you can add or remove items from any position by using index. 

Q: Define constructor.
A: A costructor is a special method of the class which gets called whenever an instance of the class is created.

Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
A: The only time Var can be used is when a local variable is declared and initialized in the same statement.

Q: What is an abstract class?
A: An abstract class is a unique type of class that cannot be instantiated.

Q: What is an interface?
A: An interface is similar to a class but it provides a specification rather than an implimentation for its members. 

Q: What is a method?
A: A method is a code block that contains a series of statements.

Q: What is a property?
A: A property is to read and write the value of a private field.

Q: What is an access specifier?
A: An access specifier is the scope of accessibility of an Object and its members.

Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
A: Supported access specifiers are public, private, protected, internal, and protected internal.

Q: What is a collection?
A: A collection is a class that specializes classes for data storage and retrieval.

Q: What is a Hash Table?
A: A Hash Table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful key value.
